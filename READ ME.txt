Music: Is From Stardew Valley with the music "Fall(Raven's Descent)" 
	This music is NOT ours but is used in this since it has a nice tune to fit the scene
	AND WILL NOT use it for comercial uses but for this class (educational purposes) only. 



Game: Get Out
A plan for the adventure. This should be a short written (and printed) document like:
1) Hero is locked in his room and progresses to each room then becomes locked out of his house and also his garage door is locked
2) Uses keys he finds a long the way to open locked doors
3) And the ultimate challenge is finding the code to the safe in the garage to get out of his house cus his house is locked 
   from the inside.
4)And he wins for escaping his house.


Grabbing all the rgb values of each object that is not passible and the walls.
Understanding:
	-The main function of def main:
		-Is that basic function of the game funtioning
	-getting events from pygame so that the:
		-characters movement
		-load screen
		-quiting game
		works since its an event that happens when a specific key or click happens
	-Getting the image to show
	-bliting the sprite/image/written variables to show
	-updating after everything has been coded

Suggestions from the TAs/Professor
	- Constructing the mini-map with a single image instead of tiles.
Some evidence of working on and understanding the code. 
You should implement the terrain-based speed control requirement. You can use the existing tiles at this point or have your own.
We will ask a few basic questions about the structure of the example code and your modifications to it.
